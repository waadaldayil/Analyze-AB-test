# Analyze-AB-test

For this project, will prefome an  A/B test for an e-commerce website.
The company developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert,"( meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product ).
our goal is to to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

In this analysis we going to use Python.
The libraries that will be used are :
 pandas
 numpy 
 random
 matplotlib.pyplot 
%matplotlib inline

At the end of this project we wil provide the company with the result and a suggestion based on it.
